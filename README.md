# PlaneSpanner
This project is part of a master's thesis titled:  
**Constructing Plane Geometric Spanner for Points in Convex Position**  
completed at Yazd University, Yazd, Iran.

In this thesis, two algorithms, named **Diametral** and **Approximate-Diametral** for constructing plane geometric spanner for points in convex position, introduced by Amani et al. in 2016  
([DOI:10.20382/jocg.v7i1a21](https://doi.org/10.20382/jocg.v7i1a21)), have been implemented in CGAL, along with a new algorithm referred to as the **Proposed algorithms**.

Additionally, these algorithms have been tested on over **7,000 point sets** in convex position.
